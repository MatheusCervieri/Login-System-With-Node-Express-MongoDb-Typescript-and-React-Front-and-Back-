Here's a checklist to help you create a login and authentication system using the mentioned technologies. This is not an exhaustive list, but it should give you a good starting point.

Set up your project structure:
a. Create a new project with React and TypeScript.
b. Set up a Node.js server with Express.
c. Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

Create user schema and model:
a. Define a User schema with fields like email, password, and any other required fields.
b. Implement password hashing using a library like bcrypt.

Implement user registration:
a. Create a registration form in the frontend with email, password, and any other required fields.
b. Add frontend form validation using a library like Formik or React Hook Form.
c. Create a POST route on the server to handle user registration.
d. Validate and sanitize user inputs using a library like express-validator.
e. Save the user to the MongoDB database.

Implement user login:
a. Create a login form in the frontend with email and password fields.
b. Add frontend form validation as done in registration.
c. Create a POST route on the server to handle user login.
d. Validate and sanitize user inputs using express-validator.
e. Check if the user exists and verify the password using bcrypt.
f. Generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) using a library like jsonwebtoken.

Implement middleware for authentication:
a. Create an Express middleware function to verify JWTs.
b. Attach the middleware to protected routes that require authentication.

Create a context or state management system in the frontend:
a. Use React Context API or a state management library like Redux.
b. Store the JWT in the state and use it to make authenticated requests.

Implement logout functionality:
a. Remove the JWT from the frontend state.
b. Optionally, implement a server-side mechanism for revoking tokens.

Implement access control:
a. Define user roles and permissions.
b. Modify the authentication middleware to check for user roles and permissions.
c. Conditionally render frontend components based on user roles and permissions.

Secure your application:
a. Implement HTTPS for your server.
b. Use secure HTTP headers with a library like helmet.
c. Use secure cookies with the "HttpOnly" and "SameSite" flags.
d. Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by implementing CSRF tokens.
e. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

Test your application:
a. Write unit tests for frontend and backend components.
b. Perform end-to-end testing with tools like Cypress or Puppeteer.
c. Conduct security testing and vulnerability assessments.
